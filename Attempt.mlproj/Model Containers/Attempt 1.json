You must use a *zester* in order to avoid getting any of that bitter rind, and when you zest the lemons, zest them onto some sugar from the recipe (the sugar will 'catch' all of the oils).

We lost it for a good while and after I found it, I originally posted it so I would never lose it again.   Thank you all for all your interest ... this is my absolute favorite pie.  During the &quot;lost&quot; phase I must have gained 20 pounds trying numerous different buttermilk pie recipes ... I was so glad when I found it again as only a few even came close in taste and texture.  I've noted a lot of people mentioning reducing the sugar, which is fine, but bear in mind that the sugar quantity was a major difference between this and other recipes I tested when it was lost.
